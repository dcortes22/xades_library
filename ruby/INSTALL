Current status
    + This is an alpha version, allows XAdES signature creation but verification is still pending

Prerequisites
    + You need to install xmldsig library. To do this go to deps and follow instructions on deps/README.ruby
    + You'll need ruby openssl gem installed

Testing that all works
    + You can tests that xades works by executing rake test

Current status
    + XAdES 1.3.2 BES signatures could be created using a PKCS12 keystore
    + Some basic interop with XAdES validators already performed

Next steps
    + Bundle this lib as a gem in order to be easily used by third apps
    + Create signature validator
    + Add support for other keystores (PKCS11, MSCAPI)
    + More testing and interop
